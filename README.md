#How to Run

Switched over to jetty, the debug cycle is infinitely easier. Allowing you to trivially test changes, need to setup and auto reloader, but that might require java rebel or some such.

<code>
mvn compile jetty:run
</code>

This way we can avoid the silly need for rewrite rules to fix up the funny URLs generated by spring, and not having to bother making the app context aware, which it shouldn't have to be.

#TODO

Have jetty have different configs for prod/dev etc, show how that would be done

The only thing now is I have the requests being mapped and used, the problem is that they're not loading the appropriate JSP as the 'view'. As far as I can tell I'm not using and JSTL tag libs, so I don't need to use the JstlView class, which I'm not, but I did try out of desperation. The only thing I can see is figuring out why the JSP file isn't be referenced properly and rendered. WEIRD!

#Notes

The annotations and the controller routes via names can't be mixed, if you want to do controllers via names you have to implement the Controller interface, that sucks. So I opted out. Of course, I'm not big on annotations either, c'est la vie.
